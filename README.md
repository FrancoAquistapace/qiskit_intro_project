# Oracle Builder Project

The goal of this project is to practice my Qiskit skills. To do this, I'll be writing a script that can take a given string of bits (for example '100101') and returns a QuantumCircuit that implements the oracle for which the string is the solution.

## Dependencies

This project was built with the following packages:
- Python (3.11.3)
